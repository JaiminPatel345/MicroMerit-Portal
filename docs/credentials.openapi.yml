  description: |
    Complete credential lifecycle management system for digital certificates.
    
    ## Features
    - **Issue Credentials**: Issuers can issue credentials to learners
    - **Claim Credentials**: Learners can claim issued credentials
    - **Revoke Credentials**: Issuers can revoke credentials with reason
    - **Verify Credentials**: Public verification by credential UID
    - **Statistics**: Get credential statistics by issuer or learner
    
    ## Credential States
    - `issued`: Credential issued but not yet claimed by learner
    - `claimed`: Credential claimed and owned by learner
    - `revoked`: Credential revoked by issuer (invalid)
    
    ## Integration
    - Links to `blockchain_record` table for blockchain hash storage
    - Links to `pdf_certificate` table for certificate generation
  version: 1.0.0
